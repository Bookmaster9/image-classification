This repo has a history of my image classification model development. The model code starts with downloading a chest xray dataset off of Kaggle. Then to preprocess the dataset, corrupted images are removed. The base model is comprised of 4 sets of convolution and maxpooling layers, followed by flatten and 2 dense layers. The model version 2 is similar to the base model, but with the addition of augmentation. To compare these models, accuracy curves and loss curves are plotted against the epochs. Additionally, a set of test images are fed in to test the trained models, and a confusion matrix and ROC curve is plotted.
